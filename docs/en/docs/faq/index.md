# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why doesn't the program exit when I click the close button?**

- A: This is because clicking the close button only closes the window, and the program is minimized to the system tray. To exit, please right-click on the tray icon and select the "Exit" option.

**Q: Where is EasyTidy's configuration file, and can I customize it?**

- A: Solution:
  - 1. By default, the configuration file is located in the `EasyTidy` folder under the `%AppData%` directory.
  - 2. You can create a `portable_config` folder in the program's root directory. When you restart the program, the configuration file will be regenerated in the `portable_config` folder. After changing the directory, the configuration will be reset to default, and all settings will be restored to their original state.
